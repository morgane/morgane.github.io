      <h1>Prototyping use cases of AR in mapping</h1>

        <mark>While at <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/" target="_blank">Mapbox</a>
        I designed and built a wide variety of AR demos and prototypes.</mark> Below are
        a few examples. All of them were built either with Unity or Xcode.
      </p>

      <div class="emoji-sep">〰️〰️〰️</div>

      <p>
        For GDC 2018, I led a team of 3 to design and build <a href="https://blog.mapbox.com/mapbox-unity-sdk-augmented-reality-space-invadar-aa2b329d762e" target="_blank">Space Invad-AR</a>, an
        AR game where you control a UFO and try to find all your lost alien friends in a city before
        time runs out. We wanted to highlight how mapping data and our Unity SDK could be used to create AR games. 
      </p>

      </div>

      <p>
        Players control the UFO by walking around a roughly 20x20 foot space. If the UFO hits a building
        (which it inevitably will), time runs out faster -- the earthlings are getting mad at you! A compass
        helps guide players to the aliens. Audio cues and animations encourage them to crouch down to abduct the aliens.
      </p>

      <p>
        We showcased this at GDC, made the source code public, and released the app on the App Store.
      </p>

        When the Magic Leap came out, we immediately used our Unity SDK to create a quick demo. We took the name 'Mapbox'
        literally and created simple boxes that people would pick up, throw, or open. Upon opening, a 3D terrain map
        would emerge. People could walk around the map and even use the controller to pan around, showing more terrain.
        They could then put the map back in the box and keep throwing the box around (which people loved to do).
      </p>

        While building out the <a href="https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-scenekit" target="_blank">Mapbox SceneKit SDK</a>, I worked on a worldscale AR app that showed people the location of national parks relative to their location. As you look around the world,
        you see a 3D horizon (to anchor the visuals to the real world) and labels of various parks.
      </p>

      <p>
        This concept was one of many we were exploring (AR walking navigation, location-based games...). I chose this one to illustrate
        "it's thattaway" possibilities of AR. I tested it out with frequent walks, did a lot of math, and added 2D and 3D elements
        to guide users through the interactions without using words.

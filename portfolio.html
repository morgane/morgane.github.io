      <h1>Portfolio</h1>
      <p>Below are samples of projects I've worked on in the last few years. They span from AR/VR work to visual design and web development. As a designer/developer hybrid, I enjoy working with new technologies and being involved in each step of the building process. I'm especially interested in building technology that is truly helpful (or fun), and I place a high emphasis on user testing and validation.</p>

      <h1>Designing beautiful 3D maps for Porsche</h1>

        is interested in using emerging technology to redefine how people drive.</mark> 
        They partnered with Mapbox to create a a high fidelity demo for the Slush 2018 conference in Helsinki.
        Specifically, they were interested in how AR or 3D could be used to create beautiful, interactive
        maps of scenic drives around the world.
      </p>

      <p>
        I worked with two other designer-developers to create an iOS app with the Mapbox SceneKit SDK. <mark>Using high quality map data, we created an animated route down the California coast with POIs, a day/night cycle, and camera control.</mark>
      </p>

      </div>

      <h2>Scoping the problem</h2>
      <p>
        The initial request was ambiguous. We could do anything in AR or 3D as long as it showcased a scenic route. Beyond that, it was up to us to decide what was both feasible and interesting. We quickly ruled out an AR solution because AR in this case didn't provide anything that couldn't be done with just 3D, and it would have been harder to calibrate and use at a conference. <mark>We ventured that a simpler 3D experience would be just as impactful and more familiar.</mark>
      </p>

      <h2>Doing the groundwork</h2>
      <p>
        We decided to use the Mapbox SceneKit SDK to make it easy for our demo to be dropped into any existing iOS app Porsche was working on. We started by brainstorming different scenic areas with interesting and robust terrain data, finally settling on the drive south to Big Sur. 
      </p>

      </div>

      <p>
        We were quickly able to achieve the bare minimum requirements: a map with camera controls. Of course, this wasn't all that interesting. To really highlight this amazing imagery, we came up with extra details that would tie the whole experience together. We wanted animated water, a day/night cycle, smooth cameras, interactive points of interest, fog in the distance... While these may have been considered "nice to haves", we reasoned that they better told the story of Porsche and 3D. <mark>A 2D map already does a great job of showing a route. A 3D map gives us an opportunity to really show what it would feel like in person.</mark>
      </p>

      <h2>Honing the details</h2>
      <p>
        From here we split up the work. I focused on the camera interactions, the lighting, and the POIs. Other people on the team focused on water animations, SDK optimizations, and designing other routes to show some variety.

      <h2>In conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Our team exceeded Porsche's expectations and by all accounts the demo was hugely successful at Slush. People enjoyed playing around with it, it worked smoothly, and most importantly it showed the art of the possible.

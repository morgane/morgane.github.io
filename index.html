          <p>I worked with SF Iron, a local weightlifting gym, to develop their brand, website and logo.</p>
          <p class="bodyText">They were a new gym that wanted to appeal to serious athletes and beginners alike, especially people who traditionally avoid weightlifting. In other words, they didn't want to be yet another gym full of really big dudes. I'm happy to say that after our work together, they're still doing really well and have a diverse clientele.</p>

          <p>At CoMedia Design, I've worked with clients from Vodafone to Hightail, designing mobile apps and refining their existing products.</p>
          <p class="bodyText">Working at an agency, I've done a bit of everything. I've spearheaded new brand strategies for small startups; I've been in charge of designing new internal apps for international corporations; I've redesigned existing websites to better meet our client's new needs.</p>
          <p class="bodyText">Given the nature of agency work, all the designs are a little hush-hush, but you can look at the <a href="http://www.comediadesign.com/" target="_blank">company website</a> to get a sense of our projects, or <a href="mailto:morganesantos+website@gmail.com?Subject=Private portfolio" target="_top">email me</a> to see my private portfolio.</p>

          <p>I designed and built a website for spontaneous art discovery, to make fine art more accessible.</p>
          <p class="bodyText">I love art: I even briefly went to art school. But I've noticed many of my friends feel uncomfortable in art museums. When I've asked them about it, it's because they don't know how to tell if something is "good", or how to talk about it.</p>
          <p class="bodyText">I don't think you need a rich background in art history to appreciate art, so I designed and built a website to walk people through a wide variety of famous (and lesser known) works, giving them just enough information to talk about art with confidence!</p>

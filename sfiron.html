          <p class="bodyText"><b>While I was freelancing, SF Iron hired me as their only designer to create a logo, website, and overall brand to convey the message of their weightlifting gym: Strength For All.</b></p>

          <p class="bodyText">After interviewing each founder about their goals and why they loved weightlifting so much, <b>I saw that lifting is about more than being strong</b>. It's about being the best person you can be, <i>no matter where you're starting from</i>. Indeed, all the founders wanted their gym to appeal to a wide variety of people, not just "bros".</p>
          <p class="bodyText">I also spoke with weightlifters who spoke passionately about the sport. I spoke with people who were outright scared of lifting. I developed a better sense of how people perceived the sport, and what stereotypes I'd have to overcome.</p>

          <p class="bodyText">Ultimately the brand had to be serious (for the hardcore athletes) but also welcoming (for everyone else). It had to be gender neutral, so women wouldn't be turned off from it. And since weightlifting is in no way glamorous, but training is an expensive, time-intensive commitment, it had to be professional without coming across as a luxury service.</p>

          <img src="photos/sfiron extra 2.png" alt="SF Iron" class="workSample">
          <p class="captionText">A few logo explorations</p>

          <p class="bodyText"><b>I sketched more logos than I can count</b>, refining them based on the aforementioned criteria. I researched color schemes that could work for the logo, website, and even the gym's interior design. I would present the founders with a few logo options to choose from, talking through what worked and what didn't. I even taught them how to give design feedback so that we could work even better together.</p>
          <p class="bodyText"><b>I also did some guerrilla user testing.</b> "This is a business logo. What do you think the business is? How would you describe it?" It was important that the logo worked outside of the context of the gym, like on a T-shirt. Based on the results from user testing, I'd make changes as needed.</p>
          <p class="bodyText">After many iterations, we settled on a logo. People knew it was a gym, even a weightlifting gym, and quite a few people said, <b>"I think I would be accepted there."</b> That was exactly what the founders wanted: for that alone, <b>the logo is a success</b>.</p>

          <img src="photos/sfiron extra 3.png" alt="SF Iron" class="workSample">
          <p class="captionText">Web design showcasing their inclusivity and strength</p>

          <p class="bodyText">With a solid logo, color scheme, and a few amazing photos taken by another photographer, I was able to put a site together quickly. Being a small business, they only needed one page with basic info: their mission, how to contact them, where they were.</p>
          <p class="bodyText">The tricky part was the copy. The founders sent me their mission statement, which I then ruthlessly edited to be much more direct. I worked with them to establish a consistent voice, and determine how they would "talk" on Facebook and Instagram. Their brand doesn't stop with the logo: it's in everything they do.</p>

          <p class="bodyText"><b>And it all worked.</b> Business is still booming, they've maintained a 5-star rating on Yelp, and their clients include every demographic you can think of: from grandmothers to male college grads. I'm personally happy to say that sometimes the grandmothers are the stronger ones.</p>

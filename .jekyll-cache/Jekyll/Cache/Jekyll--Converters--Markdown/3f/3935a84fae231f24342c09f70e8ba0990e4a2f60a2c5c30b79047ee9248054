I"¨<p>Hello and welcome to my blog (?)</p>

<p>Iâ€™m writing because, well, why are any of us doing anything right now? Coronavirus
has changed everything. Itâ€™s all we can think about. Itâ€™s a banal thing to say right
now but there it is! Everything is different and it sucks!</p>

<p>The only way Iâ€™ve been able to find any stability in my life has been to journal
every single day. All I do is write about my whiny little feelings, the people I miss,
the people I actually donâ€™t miss at all and am glad to not see anymore, the new hobbies
Iâ€™ve picked up, my creative attempts at dating when everyone has to stay 6 feet apart,
how god has completely abandoned us, etc.</p>

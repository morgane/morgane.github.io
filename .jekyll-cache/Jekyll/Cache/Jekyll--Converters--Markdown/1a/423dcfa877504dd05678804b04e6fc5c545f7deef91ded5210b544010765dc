I"¯<p>Hello and welcome to my blog (?)</p>

<p>Iâ€™m writing because, well, why are any of us doing anything right now? Coronavirus
has changed everything. Itâ€™s all we can think about. Itâ€™s a banal thing to say right
now but there it is! Everything is different and it sucks!</p>

<p>The only way Iâ€™ve been able to find any stability in my life has been to journal
every single day. All I do is write about my whiny little feelings, the people I miss,
the people I actually donâ€™t miss at all and am glad to not see anymore, the new hobbies
Iâ€™ve picked up, my creative attempts at dating when everyone has to stay 6 feet apart,
how god has completely abandoned us, etc.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve noticed a few themes in my writing, and I thought maybe itâ€™d be fun to explore them
some more, and maybe itâ€™d be fun for other people to read them, too? No oneâ€™s forcing you
to read this so if itâ€™s not fun you should close the window right now. Life is miserable
enough right now, literally donâ€™t let me add to it.</p>

<p>But if you do want to keep reading my ~diary~, here are some topics I think Iâ€™ll explore soon:</p>

<ul>
  <li>flirting is so weird right now, like for real</li>
  <li>how my beauty standards have changed in some ways but not in others, both surprising</li>
  <li>all the stuff that makes me furious as I go on my neighborhood walks</li>
  <li>looking back at my 2020 resolutions and laughing/crying</li>
  <li>everything else that has made me cry lately (including the sound of BART)</li>
</ul>

<p>and so on. Youâ€™ll be getting some raw, uncut Morgy, and maybe youâ€™ll relate to some of what I write,
or maybe you wonâ€™t at all. So yeah kind of a meaningless statement there.</p>

I"W<p>Hello and welcome to my blog (?)</p>

<p>I’m writing because, well, why are any of us doing anything right now? Coronavirus
has changed everything. It’s all we can think about. It’s a banal thing to say right
now but there it is! Everything is different and it sucks!</p>

<p>The only way I’ve been able to find any stability in my life has been to journal
every single day. All I do is write about my whiny little feelings, the people I miss,
the people I actually don’t miss at all and am glad to not see anymore, the new hobbies
I’ve picked up, my creative attempts at dating,</p>

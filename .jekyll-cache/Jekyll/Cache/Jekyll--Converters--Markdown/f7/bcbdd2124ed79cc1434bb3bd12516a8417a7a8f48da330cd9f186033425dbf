I"w<p>Hello and welcome to my blog (?)</p>

<p>I’m writing because, well, why are any of us doing anything right now? Coronavirus
has changed everything. It’s all we can think about. It’s a banal thing to say right
now but there it is! Everything is different and it sucks!</p>

<p>The only way I’ve been able to find any stability in my life has been to journal
every single day. All I do lately is journal, go for walks where I silently cry 
behind my sunglasses, journal some more, read Marx*,</p>

<p>*bro I am for real part of three (3) different Marx reading groups right now.
And you know what, I love this for me!</p>

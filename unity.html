      <h1>Creating custom maps with Mapbox and Unity</h1>
      <h2 class="bio">a case study by <a href="index.html">Morgane Santos</a></h2>
      <h3>ui design, ux design, prototyping, unity development</h3>

      <p>
        <mark><a href="https://www.mapbox.com/" target="_blank">Mapbox</a>
        creates a variety of tools to allow developers to build with live location data.</mark> 
        The Unity team created an SDK letting people make their own interactive 3D maps.
        Over time, user research revealed that people wanted more and more customization
        power, and that they also found our UI confusing. We wanted to give users better ways
        to build exactly what they had in mind while also cleaning up our designs to
        make our SDK easier to learn and play with. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <mark>I led a small team of designers/developers to create the point of interest (POI) and building replacements features.</mark> Together we conducted user interviews, created mockups, prototyped and tested them, and eventually built them into the SDK. Afterwards I wrote tutorials and documentations for these new features. As team lead I was also responsible for communicating with other teams and making sure we were always on track.
      </p>

      <h2>Understanding the problem space</h2>

      <p>
        Since we had an existing SDK already, we decided to start with usability tests to see how people used it and where they got stuck. Between myself and 2 others, we ran tens of tests with existing customer.
      </p>

      </div>

      <p>
        This was extremely helpful. We were able to see where people were getting confused with our SDK and reassess our own biases. Time and time again, the issue of customization came up. Specifically, there were two common feature requests:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li><mark>Highlight points of interest (POIs) on the map</mark></li>
        <li><mark>Replace default buildings with custom meshes</mark></li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Why POIs and buildings?</h2>
      <p>
        Before this project, the Mapbox Unity SDK still required people to do a fair amount of scripting to do any customization. It was possible to create a map with terrain and imagery (satellite imagery or map styles) with basic white rectangles extruded from building footprints to simulate real buildings. While this is fine for prototyping and proof-of-concepts, this quickly became a problem for anyone wanting to make a higher fidelity experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Specifically, people wanted to be able to highlight POIs for gameplay. Maybe you want to create an AR experience that triggers an event every time you're near a restaurant. Maybe you want to make a 3D map that labels specific museums in downtown San Franciso.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for buildings, people were rightfully tired of the basic white rectangles. It was incredibly difficult to style these rectangles, let alone change the meshes altogether. We specifically tackled mesh replacement but others on the team also focused on making it easy to add custom materials to buildings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Without POI highlighting or building replacement, the Mapbox Unity SDK was only useful for quick prototyping. <mark>By focusing on these user needs, the Mapbox Unity SDK would allow people to create their 3D maps from start to finish in one place.</mark>
      </p>


      <h2>Early flows and mockups</h2>
      <p>
        Before really diving into the design, I created a Unity UI kit for Figma so we could quickly iterate over designs (rather than having to create a dropdown menu over and over again).
      </p>

      <div class="image">
        <img class="unity-img" src="portfolio-images/unity-2.png" alt="Unity UI kit for Figma">
        <p>A Unity UI kit helped us iterate through designs much faster</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        The two main issues (highlighting POIs and replacing buildings) had surprisingly similar flows. <mark>In both cases, users may want to highlight/replace a specific building (the Empire State Building) or make procedural changes to a category of buildings (all museums in a city).</mark> While the UI would have to look different, since building replacement had more requirements, the flows had similar patterns.
      </p>

        <p>Illustrations to help communicate and align on what features were required</p>
      </div>

      <p>
        There were a few specific feature requirements. People needed to be able to select POIs and buildings by category, name, or lat-lon location. They'd need to be able to add custom assets and meshes in both cases and potentially make the POIs or buildings interactive. And this would all need to make sense to both mapping experts and people completely new to Unity and Mapbox.
      </p>

      <p>
        We worked through user flows and marked what assumptions we'd need to test at each step. This helped guide the UI design for our SDK. <mark>We wanted robust UI to allow people to do all the customizations they wanted with minimal coding.</mark> This also meant the UI had to be well-organized and easy to follow; previous SDK versions were unwieldly for people and we wanted to improve on this.
      </p>

      <h2>Bringing it into the SDK</h2>
      <p>
        We turned these mockups into clickable prototypes and tested them with in-person interviews. After refining our designs, we were ready to add them to the SDK. The backend engineers had been working on making these features possible, so we just had to code the UI to expose it to users. Once this was done, the whole team tested these features extensively to find bugs or areas we overlooked.

      </div>

      <p>
        Once the features were launched, I worked on the tutorials and documentation to help people get started and close the loop.

      </div>

      <h2>In conclusion</h2>
      <p>These features made a huge impact for our users. By starting with so much user research, we were able to design for real needs and not what we assumed was needed. <mark>A heavy emphasis on iterative design allowed us to refine the complex UI into something that was understandable even to first-time Unity or Mapbox users.</mark> Whereas previously people needed a solid understanding of mapping terms, now anyone could jump in quickly without needing to be a mapping expert.</p>

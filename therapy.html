        <div class="what">
          <p>Join us for an evening of intimate discussions about design, art, FOMO, feelings, money, and all the things no one ever told you about doing creative work. We're not a conference, we're not a meetup, we're not a networking event. We're Therapy. Leave your cellphones and business cards at the door.</p>

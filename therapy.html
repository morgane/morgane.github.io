          <p class="light">We aren't razzle-dazzled by Dribbble posts. We can't afford the hottest design conferences. We like design but we also like making video games, reading about fruit bats, thinking about Justin Bieber, doing Krav Maga, and living our truths.</p>
          <p class="light">We just wanted to do our own dang thing, you know?</p>

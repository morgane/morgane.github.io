          <h1>Tenebra</h1>
          <h2>by <a href="index.html">morgane santos</a></h2>
          <p>Tenebra is a VR experience built for Google Cardboard. I used
          Unity, Maya, the Google Cardboard SDK, and Xcode to build it. I
          created Tenebra as part of the Gray Area Incubator and
          publicly showcased it in October 2017.</p>
          <p>Tenebra is a meditative experience that anyone could access
          anywhere, anytime. There is no goal in Tenebra. It is merely a space
          for you to breathe, relax, unwind.</p>
          <p>Tenebra explores two ideas: that technology can heal us the same
          way nature does (by providing calming experiences); and that
          technology based on femininity, tenderness, and softness is
          powerful.</p>
          <p>My process involved note taking, interviews, tutorials
          about lighting in Unity,
          <a href="https://robots.thoughtbot.com/unity-lighting-basics">writing
          </a>about what I learned from those tutorials, failed experiments,
          broken builds, sketching,
          coding, debugging, Googling error messages, testing, iterating,
          creating a physical space for the experience, presenting
          it to people, and talking about my process which involved note taking,
          interviews...</p>
          <p>If you have any questions about the project or are curious about
          getting into VR yourself,

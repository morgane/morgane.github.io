          <p class="bodyText">I've noticed many people became shy when talking about art. They don't know where to begin and they don't want to seem "dumb": fine art can be really intimidating.</p>
          <p class="bodyText">But art is for everyone, so I wanted to create a type of crash course into art history, to let people enjoy art without becoming self-conscious. So first, I did some research about people's relationship to capital-A Art.</p>
          <p class="bodyText">I started with casual conversations about art, rather than directed user interviews. I spoke to people who go to museums regularly, people who only go if someone else invites them, and people who never go. Interestingly, everyone liked art, no matter how often they went to museums. If there were ever a candidate for "Universal Human Interest", art might be it.</p>
          <p class="bodyText">However, many people I spoke to thought they'd need to read lots of dry books before they could discuss art; others were simply overwhelmed by how much art is out there.</p>
          <p class="bodyText">With this in mind, I started designing a website that focused heavily on the artwork, with only the bare minimum text required to make sense of it.</p>
          <p class="bodyText">I also randomized the art, like how StumbleUpon works. It didn't make sense to split it into categories when people might not even know what those categories are. This way, you can keep moving forward and discover new genres, rather than being pigeon-holed.</p>

          <p class="captionText">Very early iteration: ended up being <i>too</i> simple, and the white didn't work as a background</p>

          <img src="photos/thegallery extra 2.png" alt="the Gallery" class="workSample">
          <p class="captionText">Iterate, iterate, iterate</p>

          <p class="bodyText">I tried emulating art galleries: white walls with tiny placards of text next to huge paintings. I added and removed information. I remembered Spotify's redesign and tried making the background black instead, something you don't often see in a gallery. I played around with the size of the image and how people moved from page to page.</p>

          <img src="photos/thegallery extra 3.png" alt="the Gallery" class="workSample">
          <p class="captionText">No half measures: I wrote full reports from my user tests, to keep track of new discoveries and changes</p>

          <p class="bodyText">Most importantly, I kept track of what I was learning. With each new design and each new round of testing, I kept careful notes to help guide me in a better direction.</p>
          <p class="bodyText">This all led to the final design, if any design is truly final. I used a rich dark background to make the images stand out even more. I ended up adding way more text than I had expected; as one user said, "I want to be able to say a fun fact about a piece at a cocktail party." I played with color and kept the website fun with splashes of pink. Why not? After all, fine art already takes itself too seriously.</p>

          <img src="photos/thegallery extra 4.png" alt="the Gallery" class="workSample">
          <p class="captionText">Latest design, keeping the focus on the image and establishing a clear hierarchy in the text</p>

          <p class="bodyText">The website only has a few pages: maybe ~10 works of art. I knew it was a success when people kept asking for more. After all, the original goal was to make art fun and accessible. I'm happy that people want to learn more about Renaissance sculpture and contemporary Korean-American illustration: it's cool stuff!</p>

          <p class="bodyText">You can play around on the <a href="http://the-gallery.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">website</a> yourself, and even read the <a href="https://github.com/morgane/the_gallery" target="_blank">source code</a>. The next step is to turn this into a video game with Unity 3D. Watch out, world.</p>
